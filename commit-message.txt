fix: enhance test reliability with improved database handling

- Increase database connection pool from 1 to 10 connections to reduce contention
- Add sleep delays (200-500ms) between database operations to prevent race conditions
- Implement proper test timeouts (60s for test suites, 30s for setup/teardown)
- Enhance error handling with fallback cleanup strategies
- Add cleanup after setupTestDb to ensure tests start with a clean state
- Install @types/uuid to fix TypeScript errors
- Update README to document test categories and running instructions

These changes ensure database tests run reliably by addressing race conditions, 
connection issues, and timing problems that were causing intermittent failures.
All integration tests are now enabled and consistently passing.

ci: fix GitHub Actions workflow for database integration tests

- Add explicit database migration step before running tests
- Create .env.test file with CI database configuration
- Update Jest config to support JEST_TIMEOUT environment variable
- Set longer timeouts for CI environment (120 seconds)

These changes ensure that database integration tests run properly in CI by
explicitly setting up the test database with migrations and providing 
adequate timeouts for the slower CI environment. 

feat: implement database query optimization for tournament feature

This commit completes ALOB-7 (Database Query Optimization) with the following improvements:

- Add strategic indexes for all tournament-related tables to optimize common query patterns
- Create database views for complex queries (active tournaments, leaderboards, stats)
- Implement optimized query functions in TypeScript with proper type safety
- Add performance testing with simulated data load
- Create comprehensive documentation of optimization strategies

These changes enhance query performance and scalability for tournament-related features
while providing a solid foundation for future development.
