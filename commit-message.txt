fix: enable database integration tests with schema and cleanup improvements

- Fixed TypeScript declarations by adding 'pg' and 'drizzle-orm' to tsconfig.json
- Enhanced test migration script to run all SQL files manually
- Fixed schema mismatch between code and database (submittedAt â†’ created_at)
- Improved database cleanup with better error handling
- Added detailed logging to track test progress
- Updated Jest configuration to control which tests are included
- Added documentation explaining test setup and fixes

The database integration tests now run correctly as part of the regular test suite.
Only the complex integration test remains skipped for future work.
