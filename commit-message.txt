fix: enhance test reliability with improved database handling

- Increase database connection pool from 1 to 10 connections to reduce contention
- Add sleep delays (200-500ms) between database operations to prevent race conditions
- Implement proper test timeouts (60s for test suites, 30s for setup/teardown)
- Enhance error handling with fallback cleanup strategies
- Add cleanup after setupTestDb to ensure tests start with a clean state
- Install @types/uuid to fix TypeScript errors
- Update README to document test categories and running instructions

These changes ensure database tests run reliably by addressing race conditions, 
connection issues, and timing problems that were causing intermittent failures.
All integration tests are now enabled and consistently passing.
