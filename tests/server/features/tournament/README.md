# Database Integration Tests

This directory contains database integration tests for the tournament features. These tests are temporarily excluded from the normal test run (`npm test`) due to dependency issues that need to be fixed.

## Running Database Tests

To run the database integration tests:

```bash
# Make sure the test database is properly set up
npm run db:migrate:test

# Run the database integration tests
npm run test:db
```

## Current Issues

The database integration tests are currently experiencing the following issues:

1. Missing TypeScript type declarations for some modules (`drizzle-orm`, `pg`, `@jest/globals`)
2. Table existence issues (e.g., "relation 'tournament_participants' does not exist")
3. Foreign key constraint violations

## Planned Fixes

These issues will be addressed in a future update, which may include:

1. Adding proper type declarations
2. Ensuring that all required tables are created in test migrations
3. Resolving foreign key constraint violations
4. Improving database cleanup between tests

## Test Files

- `integration.test.ts`: General database integration tests
- `tournament-participants.test.ts`: Tests for tournament participant functionality
- `tournament-scores.test.ts`: Tests for tournament scoring functionality  
- `notifications.test.ts`: Tests for notification functionality

## Temporary Workaround

For now, these tests are excluded from the regular test run, which allows the CI/CD pipeline to continue functioning while these issues are being addressed. To include them in your local testing, use the `npm run test:db` command.
